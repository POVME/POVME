Run these files in the same directory as the location of the .npy files.

To run the scripts binding_site_overlap.py and cluster,py:

First: run binding_site_overlap.py.
    The required inputs are the set of .npy files produced by POVME2.py
    ex: "python binding_site_overlap.py -f *.npy"
    
    Output: Similarity matricies for Tanimoto and Tversky calculations. 

Second: run cluster.py,
    The required inputs are:
        indexMapToFrames.csv from binding_site_overlap.py
        csv file produced by binding_site_overlap.py (either Tanimoto
            or Tversky)
        the number of clusters wanted
    ex: "python cluster.py indexMapToFrames.csv 2 POVME_Tanimoto_matrix.csv"
    
    Output: frames_centroid.csv, which contains where each frame is clustered
