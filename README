# Welcome to the Amarolab Code repository
# Here you will find software developed in our lab
#
# Please add the software to the list below
# Also inlcude a list of the developer(s)
#
#
# Software: 
# 
# POVME
# LipidWrapper
# EnsembleDockingStats
# Binana and Peel
#
# We recommend defining the alias
# alias arun="\`find ../ ../../ ../../../ ../../../../ -maxdepth 1 -name arun\`"
# which will set the proper PYTHONPATH environmental variables at runtime
# to include co-dependent Amaro lab code. This can be used, for example, in
# the peel test-case binana/tests/algebra_func_input by typing
# arun python funcInputTest.py
