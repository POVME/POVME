This subdirectory contains fake POVME-style data intended for use in validating new post-processing features. The test cases each contain simulated POVME data in the form of an idealized spherical binding pocket with variably-open subpockets coming off in different locations. The higher difficulty levels contain more numerous, smaller subpockets, with larger levels of random "noise" added to their positions. 

Each folder contains a makeTestCase.py script which will make a set of pockets of varying difficulty for analysis. makeTestCase.py must be run with the "arun" script (for example "../../../arun python makeTestCase.py"). These pockets are generated by a combination of overlapping spheres in space. The higher difficulty levels include higher levels of random noise added to the sphere positions, more numerous subpockets, and smaller subpockets. Upon being run, the script will produce a set of pockets in both .pdb and .npy form, identified by which pocket "family" they belong to. The script will also the randomly shuffle the pockets and save a set of "shuffled" files, identified only by number. The "key_<DATE>" file contains the back-mapping of these shuffled ID numbers back to their original family IDs and whole file names.

In order to evaluate the success of an attempted pocket clustering, there is a script called "scoreSolution.py". This script takes as inputs two "key" files - One which actually contains the real solution and the other which contains the attempted solution (in terms of formatting, only the first column is read from both). This script is agnostic to the numbering used in the clustering attempt. The final score returned is equal to the number of correctly-paired residues in the attemped solution. It will also perform bootstrap resampling analysis, which is my best effort at controlling for attemptd solutions which put everything in the same cluster.
