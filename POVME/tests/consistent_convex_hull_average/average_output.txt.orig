Generating the pocket-encompassing point field

Saving the point field as a PDB and NPY file
	Point field saved to ./average_frameInfo/inclusion.pdb to permit visualization
	Point field saved to ./average_frameInfo/inclusion.npy to optionally load for the volume calculation


Saving the contiguous-pocket seed points as a PDB and NPY file
	Contiguous-pocket seed points saved to ./average_frameInfo/seed.pdb to permit visualization
	Point field saved to ./average_frameInfo/seed.npy to optionally load for the volume calculation
