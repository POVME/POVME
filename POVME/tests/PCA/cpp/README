This is the c++ implementation of the PCA analyzer and Bayes correlation
methods of examining POVME binding pocket data.

The Bayes information is produced in the files labelled STDOUT; it can be
safely ignored.

=============COMPILATION=====================

Prior to execution, the executable (prob_matrix_creator.cpp) must be 
compiled and linked to the GSL standard linear algebra libraries. This
requires the correced installation of GSL on your machine. This compilation
can be achieved via the following command:

	g++ -Wall -I/usr/include/gsl prob_matrix_creator.cpp -lgsl -lgslcblas

============EXECUTION========================

To execute the command, it is assumed that numpy and vmd are both installed;
vmd must be executable from the command line by typing "vmd"

Example execution;

	./run_coordinate_correlator.ba

To the screen (through STDERR), the eigenvalues of all principal components
will be printed. This can be saved for the use of constructing a scree plot

Eigenvectors of the covariance matrix will be saved in files labelled with 
a *.vect suffix. To convert these to pdb files, run the following command 
from the terminal

	./convert_vect_to_pdbs.ba

All principal components will be created in a directory labelled cpp_pc_pdbs.
