POVME_PCA.py is a script which uses the numpy/scipy libraries to perfor
principal component analysis on POVME style binding pocket data.

Input required is the list of POVME_framexx.npy arrays identified as 
part of the binding pocket during an MD simulation.

The python file must be placed in the same directory as the accompanying
.tcl script; this turns the principal component vectors from a list of 
floating point numbers to a .pdb file. As coded, it does this only for
the first 10 principal components-this could be changed if desired.

All principal components will be output to the principal_components
directory created during execution. The file produced in the running 
directory labelled PC_screeplot can be used to determine if the PCA has
converged.

REMINDER: As written, only the first 10 principal components are output.
This should not be hard-coded, but some discussion may remain on the best
method to implement an adjustable threshold.

Example execution:

	./run_POVME_PCA.ba

To view scree plot follow these steps;

	user$: gnuplot
	user$: plot './PC_screeplot.dat' w boxes

Histogram plot appears as normalized % contributions to total variance.

The plot should trend to zero after numframes-1.
